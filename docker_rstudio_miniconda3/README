##----------
this one is not working for rstudio server.

when installing through conda, it only works for rstudio desktop (IDE) but not server.

!!! 

need to work out other ways, say rocker/rstudio with conda miniconda.

see 
+ 1) clearlinux_JupyterRstudio
manually install rstudio-server with source and then install conda.
this should work (still need to work out the details for invoke the server, but building and installation are working.

on top of clearlinux!!! in order to reduce the size of images

+ 2) myDocker_rstudio/
working rstudio, but no conda!!!


##---------------
This is a project used to test for doing rstudio with conda environment (miniconda3).
This one is based on the SComatic (see that for starting). 
Also we are testing and how we can test out and initiate rstudio.
