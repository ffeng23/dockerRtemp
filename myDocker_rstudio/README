this folder we try to test use docker with rstudio for my own project

1) docker
2) os ubuntu or debian
3) rstudio with R
4) volume for project
5) data


# there are two yamls 

could be called by

docker compose -f <yaml file name> up 



# yaml files
- docker-compose.yml
    default one to call to run rstudio with a specified folders, etc
    
    docker compose up
    
- docker-compose_commandlineR.yml
    call to start R or other bash in commandline.
    
    docker compose -f docker-compose_commandlineR.yml up -d
    docker compose exec app bash
    
    (or docker compose exec app R ) 

    The first one is to start bash and second one is to start R in commandline .
    
    The first one will give us a bash and once we in that bash, we could call to start R or start rstudio ("/init")
