    #NOTES about directory mapping: IMPORTANT. we need to map two folders.
    #   + the software/app folder related to the cnvkit and docker files. The directory and mapping should be fixed
    #       change this only when we modify the docker ro cnvkit ----- container related
    #   + this is part mapping to the real project with data on the host machine. Need to customize.
    #       make sure it contains everything to run
    #   + we added one more, mainly because the data is separated (because they are huge) from the project. 
    #       Of course we can always do this to have a separated folder/mapping for something . need to modify/custermize

## to run the build using
#  dockcompose compose build

#  to run it
#  1) modify the .env file if necessary
#  2) docker compose up -d # run in background
#  3) docker compose exec vep_2 bash # run bash as root
#  4) docker compose exec vep_2 su - user1 #run as user1
#  5) how to invoke conda env SComatic???? (need to work out)
# ---- 
#  6) if this is the jupyter container need to run jupyter-lab with --ip="0.0.0.0"
#       which allows for listening to the ip in order to access from web UI from 
#          host into container
#  7) also need to open up the port for host to access container's port from outside
#      see it in the above "ports:\n\t 8888:8888
