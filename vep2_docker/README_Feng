# README
NOTE by Feng: this one is the github tracking folder for VEP2 docker

it started from mskcc vcf2maf project. here mainly we kept original/old
version of perl scripts and also Dockerfile. to make the image with
all resources, vcf2maf and vep.
currently it is v1.0 on docker hub. 

the docker-compose.yml is not supposed to work here. need to specify 
the input and ref (cache vep) in the working folder.
SNS101Seq/Data/mutation!!!!
also it is supposed to work with snakemake (not necessarily)

## Project

This project is originally from https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf

## What I did.

I modified docker and added docker-compose yaml to make it an image that can 
be used by my own project (SNS101Seq).

## PLEASE DON'T update this folder (??)

# Files:

Dockerfile: has been modified by me on 12/17/2024.
        In this one, the original making is to make use of clearlinux and 
        then install the clearlinux again to a folder, which is then copied to
        the minimal image (SCRATCH) and also install conda and necessary packages under it 
        which are then copied to the new system to a system folder, /usr/local.
        this way is to keep the image smaller. 
        
        Note that the conda itself is not working, since conda itself is installed to the
        builder image, and its all installed package do work and copied to the 
        docker container. Again, conda is installed to /usr/ folder, but not copied to
        the container. 
        
        A very good strategy. need to follow.
        
        The caveat is that when we try to install R on clearlinux. the container grows too big,
        bigger than other system (ubuntu or debian) containers. Need to keep eyes on this.
        
        
        
Dockerfile.orig: this is the one originally from the repo. 

docker-compose.yaml: I added on 12/17/2024. need to modified the mapping of folder to connect to
    different real folder for data and reference sequences.
