R and Minicode Image --- not necessary now.

Feng 12/18/2023

This is the project that we try to build my own image with R docker and Miniconda, which can be used 
by later project to use.

We started with R code on Ubuntu and add Miniconda. We will also add mamba to it.

See Docker file.




NOTE:::::: At this moment, we don't need to this. Since we usually can do system R and manager packages and dependencies system-wise.

Otherwise under current configuration, the rstudio is system-wise and if we have to do conda we have to "push" rstudio to under

different conda env. So then there is no point to do rstudio and then conda and then rstudo under env again.


We might need to do this later??? 

or change the configure to have conda image first and then under conda to install R/Rstudio later.
