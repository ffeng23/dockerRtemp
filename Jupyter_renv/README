# a small project to test how to incorporate renv in jupyter r project

## it seems there are two hard issuses
- with sub-folders in the project

    solution: write special .Rprofile for each subfolder.
    
- how to keep track of R packages in renv.lock? Because renv doesn't check
  .pyinb files for R packages. 

    answer: R will check in each folder for .Rprofile. This way it will load through
    activate.R code for renv local libraries.

see explanations in the github reposition about this issue.


## Note about base image
jupyter/r-notebook

this base image using conda for jupyter (/opt/conda). So R is also installed under conda.
This means that some packages are installed under conda too and we need to add dependencies
under conda (such as, pkg-config, pandoc, make, etc. ). For some special one, we might need
to go to use R studio images, since they have system-wise R installation.
