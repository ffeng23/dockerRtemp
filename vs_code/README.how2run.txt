# README on how to run the dockers.

##  Dockefile,

+ need to change the id and user name to match the host user id.
note: the default user name is 'abc', defined by vs-code server original docker image

Need to work on this later to see how to change the user id.

+ if this is for R ide, we need to specify the R version.

##  docker-compose

+ change id and group id

+ specify the password.

+ take care of the disk volume (?)
