## Aims

This is a project used to build docker image for the tools used for analyzing copy number data.
It mainly hostes the cnvkit tool and gistic2 program. We might add more later.

## Prerequisites

+ cnvkit prerequisite

 reference: 

+ gistic2 prerequisite.

+ we also need snakemake ability.

+ it is also worth mentioning that in here we manage the user identity and folder permission.

## Information about files 
there is a snakemake file example in 

SNS101Seq/Data/Copynumber

it is named as "Snakefile_runCnvkit2_batch3_08112024_docker_example"

## how to make docker container

need to download "GISTIC_2_0_23.tar.gz" and also "hg19.mat"


## how to run?

see the docker compose yaml file. At the end, it shows how to run the docker container.

It works as a bash mode and supposed to be run as a user instead of the root mode.

Need to map to the correct folders in the docker compose yaml :
1) bind the data volume to contains both reference genome and data input
2) bind the project folder with the snakemake and write the output.


3) docker compose up -d #backgroud mode
4) docker compose exec scomatic_2 su - user1

5) modify the snakefile to use the cnvkit 

6) run Gistic2 (need to work more on this).
