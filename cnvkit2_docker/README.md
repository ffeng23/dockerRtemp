# README for the Repo

## this one started from CopyNumberAnalysis repo on github.

starting 9/3/2025 moved to this subfolder of the docker project.

Stop updating the original copynumberAnalysis repo.


## Docker files

Please use Dockerfile_continuouHub.

The original one, Dockerfile, might work but need more tweak to make sure everything is doing right.

It needs environment_snakemake.yam and r_requirements_install.R to work.

Also need .env and please REMEMBER to change it contents accordingly.


## docker-compose.yml

this one is NOT supposed to be here. It needs to be inside the project folder. It is placed here to be a placeholder. Need to modify the image and mapping volumes.
